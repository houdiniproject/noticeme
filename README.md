# NOTICEME

A NOTICE.txt generator for npm packages.

# Usage

npx noticeme

# Features/Problems

This uses the https://clearlydefined.io/ service and data to generate the
NOTICE.txt file

# TODO

- Tests
- Better error handling
- Fallback to package.json's "license" if ClearlyDefined doesn't have it
